# API Authentication

All requests to the Mantlz API require authentication using your API key. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API key.

## Obtaining an API Key

To get an API key:

1. Log in to your [Mantlz Dashboard](https://mantlz.app/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Name your API key and click **Generate**
5. Copy and securely store your API key

<Note type="warning">
  API keys are only displayed once at creation time. If you lose your key, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

There are two ways to authenticate your API requests:

### 1. API Key Header (Recommended)

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.mantlz/api/v1/forms/list" \
  -H "X-API-Key: mk_your_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Query Parameter

Alternatively, you can pass your API key as a query parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.mantlz/api/v1/forms/list?apiKey=mk_your_api_key_here"
```

<Note type="info">
  The header method is recommended as it's more secure than including your API key in URLs.
</Note>

## API Key Security

To keep your API key secure:

- Never share your API key publicly
- Do not include your API key in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store your API key in server-side code
- Revoke and replace API keys if they are compromised
- Consider using different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. When a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100      # Maximum requests allowed in the period
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99   # Requests remaining in the current period
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000   # Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
```

When you receive a rate limit error, wait until the reset time before making additional requests.
