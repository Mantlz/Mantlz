# Form Schema

The Mantlz SDK handles all form schema management internally. You don't need to implement or manage any schema yourself - just use our components and the SDK takes care of everything else.

## Overview

When you use the Mantlz SDK, forms are automatically configured and managed based on your form ID. The SDK:

- Fetches the form schema automatically
- Handles field validation
- Manages form state
- Processes form submissions
- Handles error states
- Manages loading states

## Usage

Using a form is as simple as:

```tsx
import { Mantlz } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Mantlz 
      formId="your-form-id"
      onSuccess={(data) => {
        console.log('Form submitted successfully!', data);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

That's it! The SDK handles everything else internally.

## Behind the Scenes

While you don't need to implement these yourself, here's what the SDK manages for you:

### Form Configuration

The SDK automatically handles:

```typescript
interface FormConfig {
  id: string;              // Your form ID
  name: string;            // Form name
  fields: FormField[];     // Form fields
  validation: object;      // Validation rules
  theme?: string;          // Theme configuration
  submitButton?: {         // Submit button customization
    text: string;
    style?: object;
  };
}
```

### Field Management

Each field is automatically configured with:

```typescript
interface FormField {
  id: string;              // Field ID
  name: string;            // Field name
  type: string;            // Field type
  required: boolean;       // Required status
  placeholder?: string;    // Placeholder text
  label?: string;         // Field label
  options?: string[];     // For select/radio/checkbox
  defaultValue?: any;     // Default value
  accept?: string[];      // For file uploads
  maxSize?: number;       // For file uploads
}
```

## What You Don't Need to Worry About

The SDK automatically handles:

1. **Schema Fetching**: Forms are automatically fetched and configured
2. **Validation**: Built-in validation based on field types
3. **Error Handling**: Automatic error state management
4. **Loading States**: Loading indicators during form operations
5. **Field Rendering**: Appropriate field components based on type
6. **State Management**: Form state is managed internally
7. **Submission Logic**: Form submission and response handling
8. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types are handled automatically

## Example: Complete Form Implementation

Here's all you need to implement a complete form:

```tsx
import { Mantlz } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <Mantlz
      formId="contact-form"
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The SDK handles everything else:
- Fetches the form configuration
- Renders the appropriate fields
- Manages form state
- Handles validation
- Processes submission
- Manages error states
- Provides loading indicators
- Handles success/error responses

## Best Practices

1. **Use Form IDs**: Always use the correct form ID from your Mantlz dashboard
2. **Handle Success**: Implement the onSuccess callback for post-submission actions
3. **Trust the SDK**: Let the SDK handle validation and error states
4. **Use TypeScript**: The SDK provides full type safety automatically

Remember: The Mantlz SDK is designed to handle all the complex form management for you. You don't need to worry about schema implementation, validation logic, or state management - just use our components and let the SDK do the heavy lifting!
