# Client Configuration

The Mantlz SDK comes with sensible defaults and automatic configuration. While most users won't need to modify any settings, the SDK provides configuration options for advanced use cases.

## Quick Start

For most applications, you only need to provide your API key:

```tsx
import { MantlzProvider } from "@mantlz/nextjs";

function App() {
  return (
    <MantlzProvider apiKey="your-api-key">
      {/* Your app content */}
    </MantlzProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! The SDK automatically configures everything else with optimal defaults.


## Configuration Options Explained



The SDK provides built-in toast notifications for:

- Form submission success/failure
- Validation errors
- API key issues
- Network errors


```

The SDK automatically caches:

- Form schemas
- Validation rules
- API responses

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Use the default configuration unless you have specific needs
3. **Caching**: Keep caching enabled for better performance
4. **Error Handling**: Use built-in notifications for standard error handling


## Default Values

The SDK uses these sensible defaults:

```typescript
const defaultConfig = {
  notifications: true,
  showApiKeyErrorToasts: true,
  developmentMode: false,
  credentials: "include",
  corsMode: "cors",
  cache: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes
  },
};
```

Remember: The Mantlz SDK is designed to work optimally out of the box. Only customize the configuration if you have specific requirements that differ from the defaults.
