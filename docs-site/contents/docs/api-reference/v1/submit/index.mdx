# Form Submission

The Mantlz SDK handles form submissions automatically. You don't need to implement the submission logic yourself - the SDK takes care of everything including validation, file uploads, and response handling.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to submit a form is to use the `MantlzForm` component:

```tsx
import { MantlzForm } from '@mantlz/sdk';

function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <MantlzForm
      formId="your-form-id"
      onSuccess={(response) => {
        console.log('Form submitted successfully!', response);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

That's it! The SDK handles everything else automatically.

## Features Handled by the SDK

The SDK automatically manages:

- **Data Validation**: Validates all form fields before submission
- **File Uploads**: Handles file uploads with automatic processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Manages submission rates to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Provides comprehensive error management
- **Success Responses**: Formats and processes successful submissions
- **Redirects**: Handles post-submission redirects
- **Analytics**: Captures relevant analytics data

## Response Types

The submission response includes:

```typescript
interface FormSubmitResponse {
  success: boolean;          // Whether the submission was successful
  data?: any;               // Response data if successful
  submissionId?: string;    // Unique submission identifier
  message?: string;         // Response message
  redirect?: {              // Optional redirect information
    url: string;
    allowed: boolean;
    reason?: string;
  };
}
```

## Advanced Usage

While the SDK handles everything automatically, you can customize the submission behavior if needed:

```tsx
import { MantlzForm } from '@mantlz/sdk';

function CustomForm() {
  return (
    <MantlzForm
      formId="your-form-id"
    />
  );
}
```

## File Uploads

The SDK automatically handles file uploads:

```tsx
<MantlzForm
  formId="your-form-id"
  onSuccess={(response) => {
    // File URLs are included in the response
    console.log('Uploaded files:', response.data.files);
  }}
/>
```

The SDK manages:
- File size validation
- Upload progress
- File type validation
- Secure URL generation

## Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
interface MantlzError {
  message: string;           // Error message
  code: number;             // Error code
  userMessage?: string;     // User-friendly message
  details?: any;            // Additional error details
}
```

Common error scenarios handled automatically:
- Invalid form ID
- API key issues
- Rate limiting
- File upload failures
- Validation errors
- Network errors

## Best Practices

1. **Use the Built-in Component**: Let the `MantlzForm` component handle submissions
2. **Implement Success Handlers**: Add `onSuccess` handlers for post-submission logic
3. **Trust the SDK**: Allow the SDK to manage validation and error handling
4. **Handle Redirects**: Use the provided redirect information for navigation
5. **Monitor Responses**: Use the submission ID for tracking if needed

## Rate Limiting

The SDK automatically handles rate limiting:
- Manages submission frequency
- Provides clear error messages
- Includes retry-after information
- Prevents submission abuse

## Example: Complete Implementation

```tsx
import { MantlzForm } from '@mantlz/sdk';

function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <MantlzForm
      formId="contact-form"
    />
  );
}
```

Remember: The Mantlz SDK is designed to handle all form submission complexities automatically. You don't need to worry about the submission process, validation, or error handling - just use our components and let the SDK manage everything for you!
