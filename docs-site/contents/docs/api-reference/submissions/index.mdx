```
POST /forms/submit
```

GET /forms/{formId}/submissions
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Custom Forms**: Submit data from custom-built forms on your website
- **Data Export**: Export form submissions for analysis in external tools
- **Integration**: Connect Mantlz forms with other systems in your workflow

## Example: Submitting Form Data

```javascript
async function submitFormData(formId, data) {
  const response = await fetch('https://app.mantlz.com/api/v1/forms/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-API-Key': 'mk_your_api_key_here'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      formId: formId,
      data: data
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Example usage
submitFormData('form_123abc', {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe',
  message: 'This is my feedback'
});
