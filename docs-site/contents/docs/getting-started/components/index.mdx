# Mantlz Form Components

The Mantlz SDK provides React components for creating dynamic forms. All form configurations are managed through the Mantlz dashboard and fetched automatically based on form IDs.

## Mantlz Component

The main component that dynamically renders any type of form based on its configuration:

```tsx
import { mantlz } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

<mantlz 
  formId="your-form-id"
  title="Form Title"
  description="Form description"
/>
```

## Key Features

### Dynamic Form Configuration

All forms are dynamically configured through the Mantlz dashboard:
- Form fields and validation rules are fetched automatically
- Update form structure without code changes
- Add, remove, or modify fields through the dashboard
- Maintain consistent form behavior across implementations

### Form Type Features

Depending on the form type configured in the dashboard, additional features are available:

#### Waitlist Forms
For forms configured as waitlist type:
```tsx
<mantlz
  formId="your-waitlist-form-id"
  showUsersJoined={true} // Show number of users who joined
  usersJoinedLabel="people on the waitlist" // Custom label
  usersJoinedPosition="top" // Position of the counter: "top" | "bottom"
/>
```

#### Feedback Forms
For forms configured as feedback type:
```tsx
<mantlz
  formId="your-feedback-form-id"
  showRating={true} // Show star rating input
  ratingLabel="Rate your experience" // Custom rating label
/>
```

### Event Handlers

Handle form submissions and errors with callback functions:

```tsx
<mantlz
  formId="your-form-id"
  onSubmitSuccess={(data) => {
    console.log('Form submitted successfully:', data);
  }}
  onSubmitError={(error) => {
    console.error('Form submission failed:', error);
  }}
/>
```

### Appearance Customization

While fields are dynamic, you can still customize the form's appearance:

```tsx
<mantlz
  formId="your-form-id"
  appearance={{
    elements: {
      // Customize button style
      formButtonPrimary: 'bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-400 text-sm',
      // Customize input style
      input: 'bg-zinc-100 border-zinc-300',
      // Customize card style
      card: 'shadow-lg rounded-lg',
      // Style users joined counter (for waitlist forms)
      usersJoinedCounter: 'text-xl font-bold text-purple-600',
      usersJoinedLabel: 'text-sm text-gray-600',
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Post-Submission Redirects

Redirect users after successful form submission (STANDARD and PRO plans):

```tsx
<mantlz
  formId="your-form-id"
  redirectUrl="/thank-you"
/>
```
