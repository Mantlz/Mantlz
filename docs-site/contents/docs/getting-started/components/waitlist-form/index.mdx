# WaitlistForm Component

The `WaitlistForm` component creates forms for collecting email addresses from users interested in your product or service.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { WaitlistForm } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

export default function WaitlistPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
      <WaitlistForm 
        formId="your-waitlist-id"
        title="Join Our Waitlist"
        description="Sign up to get early access to our new product."
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Users Joined Counter

WaitlistForm can display a counter showing how many users have already joined:

```tsx
<WaitlistForm
  formId="your-waitlist-id"
  title="Join Our Waitlist"
  description="Be among the first to try our platform"
  showUsersJoined={true}
  usersJoinedLabel="people have already joined"
/>
```

## Text Customization

```tsx
<WaitlistForm
  formId="your-waitlist-id"
  title="Join Our Private Beta"
  description="Get early access to our AI-powered platform"
  submitButtonText="Join Waitlist"
  emailPlaceholder="Enter your email address"
  successMessage="You're on the list! We'll be in touch soon."
/>
```

## Event Handlers

```tsx
<WaitlistForm
  formId="your-waitlist-id"
  onSubmitSuccess={(data) => {
    // Handle successful submission
    console.log('Email:', data.email);
    analytics.track('Waitlist Joined', { email: data.email });
  }}
  onSubmitError={(error) => {
    // Handle submission error
    console.error('Submission failed:', error);
  }}
/>
```

## Post-Submission Redirects

After form submission, you can specify a custom redirect URL (STANDARD and PRO plans only):

```tsx
<WaitlistForm
  formId="your-waitlist-id"
  redirectUrl="/thank-you" // Custom redirect URL (premium feature)
/>
```

> Note: Free plan users will always be redirected to Mantlz's hosted thank-you page.
