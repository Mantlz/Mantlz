# Installing Mantlz SDK

Mantlz SDK is a modern, customizable React component library for building beautiful forms including feedback, contact, and waitlist forms with dark mode support.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Mantlz SDK, make sure you have:

- A React project (Next.js, Create React App, Vite, etc.)
- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager

<Note title="SDK Compatibility" type="info">
  Mantlz SDK is compatible with React 18+ and supports both client-side and server-side rendering.
</Note>

## Setup for Next.js

For Next.js applications, we recommend using our specialized package:

```bash
npm install @mantlz/nextjs
```

## Adding the Provider

Wrap your application with the MantlzProvider to enable form functionality:

```tsx
// In your _app.tsx or layout.tsx file
import { MantlzProvider } from "@mantlz/nextjs";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <MantlzProvider apiKey={process.env.MANTLZ_KEY}>
      {children}
    </MantlzProvider>
  );
}
```

<Note title="API Key" type="warning">
  You'll need to add your Mantlz API key to your environment variables.
  Add `MANTLZ_KEY=mk_xxxxxxxxxx` to your .env.local file.
</Note>

## Basic Usage Example

Once installed, you can import and use any of our form components:

```tsx
import { FeedbackForm } from 'mantlz-sdk';

function MyFeedbackPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">We value your feedback</h1>
      
      <FeedbackForm 
        formId="my-feedback-form"
        onSubmitSuccess={(data) => console.log('Feedback submitted:', data)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
