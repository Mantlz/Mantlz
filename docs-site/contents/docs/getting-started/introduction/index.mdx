# Introduction to Mantlz SDK

Mantlz is a powerful form management SDK for React applications that provides a complete solution for building and managing forms. It offers a structured form building system with predefined field types, extensive customization options, and a seamless developer experience.

## Key Features

### Form Management
- **Predefined Field Types**: Build forms using our set of validated field types
- **Form Validation**: Built-in validation support using Zod
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with toast notifications
- **Theme System**: Multiple built-in themes with customization options
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with type definitions

## Getting Started

To start using Mantlz in your project:

```bash
npm install @mantlz/nextjs
# or
yarn add @mantlz/nextjs
# or
pnpm add @mantlz/nextjs
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { MantlzProvider, Mantlz } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

function App() {
  return (
    <MantlzProvider apiKey="your_api_key">
      <Mantlz 
        formId="your_form_id"
        theme="modern"
      />
    </MantlzProvider>
  );
}
```


## Form Validation

Mantlz uses Zod for form validation with predefined validation rules for each field type:

```tsx
const validation = {
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  message: z.string().min(10, 'Message must be at least 10 characters')
};
```

## Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive error handling:

```tsx
<Mantlz 
  formId="your_form_id"
/>
```

## Theme Customization

Choose from built-in themes or customize the appearance:

```tsx
<Mantlz 
  formId="your_form_id"
  theme="modern"
/>

```
