# File Upload

The Mantlz SDK provides built-in support for file uploads with drag-and-drop functionality, validation, and automatic handling.

## Basic Usage

File upload fields are configured in your Mantlz dashboard and automatically rendered by the SDK:

```tsx
import { Mantlz } from '@mantlz/nextjs';

<Mantlz formId="your-form-id" />
```

## Configuration Options

File upload fields support several configuration options that can be set in your dashboard:

### Field Properties

```typescript
interface FileField extends FormField {
  type: 'file';
  accept?: string[];        // Allowed file types
  maxSize?: number;         // Maximum file size in bytes
  required?: boolean;       // Is the field required?
}
```

### Accept Types

Specify which file types are allowed using the `accept` array:

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "name": "document",
  "label": "Upload Document",
  "accept": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx"]
}
```

You can use file extensions or MIME types:

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "name": "image",
  "label": "Upload Image",
  "accept": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", "image/*"]
}
```

### File Size Limits

Set maximum file size in bytes using the `maxSize` property:

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "name": "image",
  "label": "Upload Image",
  "maxSize": 5242880,
  "accept": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png"]
}
```

### Required Files

Make file upload mandatory using the `required` property:

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "name": "resume",
  "label": "Upload Resume",
  "required": true,
  "accept": [".pdf"]
}
```

## Built-in Validation

The SDK automatically validates file uploads with the following checks:

### File Size Validation
- Validates against the `maxSize` property (default: 10MB)
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Prevents upload if file exceeds limit

### File Type Validation
- Validates against the `accept` array
- Supports both file extensions (`.pdf`) and MIME types (`image/*`)
- Blocks unsupported file types

### Required Field Validation
- Ensures required file fields are not empty
- Integrates with form validation system
- Shows appropriate error states

## How File Uploads Work

The SDK handles file uploads seamlessly:

1. **Drag & Drop Interface**
   - Users can drag files directly onto the upload area
   - Click to browse and select files
   - Visual feedback during file selection

2. **Automatic Validation**
   - Real-time file type and size checking
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Integration with form validation

3. **Upload Processing**
   - Files are processed when the form is submitted
   - Secure handling and storage
   - Automatic integration with form data

## Examples

### Basic Document Upload

```json
{
  "id": "document",
  "name": "document",
  "type": "file",
  "label": "Upload Document",
  "required": true,
  "accept": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx"],
  "maxSize": 5242880
}
```

### Image Upload

```json
{
  "id": "profile",
  "name": "profile",
  "type": "file",
  "label": "Profile Picture",
  "required": true,
  "accept": ["image/*"],
  "maxSize": 2097152
}
```

### Optional File Upload

```json
{
  "id": "attachment",
  "name": "attachment",
  "type": "file",
  "label": "Additional Document",
  "required": false,
  "accept": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".txt"],
  "maxSize": 10485760
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **File Size Limits**
   - Set reasonable size limits based on your use case
   - Consider user bandwidth and storage requirements
   - Default limit is 10MB, adjust as needed

2. **File Type Restrictions**
   - Only allow necessary file types for security
   - Use specific extensions (`.pdf`) for strict validation
   - Use MIME types (`image/*`) for broader categories

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear labels and instructions
   - Show accepted file types and size limits
   - Use descriptive error messages

4. **Form Design**
   - Place file uploads logically in your form
   - Make required file fields clearly marked
   - Test with various file types and sizes

## Error Handling

The SDK automatically handles common file upload errors:

- **File too large**: Shows size limit message
- **Invalid file type**: Lists accepted file types
- **Required field empty**: Standard form validation error
- **Upload failure**: Network or server error handling

All errors are displayed inline with the file upload field and integrate with the form's validation system.
