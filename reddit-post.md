# Advice for Form SDK in the making

Hey there,

I am building an SDK that makes adding forms into your application easy. The goal is to provide developers with a simple, powerful toolkit to integrate beautiful, functional forms into any web application with just a few lines of code (no need to build form handling, validation, or submission management from scratch).

Can you give me some feedback about the features necessary for such a platform? Here is the current version:

https://mantlz.com

## Current Features:
- **Simple Integration**: Add forms to any React/Next.js app with a single component
- **Pre-built Components**: Ready-to-use form elements that work out of the box
- **Automatic Validation**: Built-in form validation with customizable rules
- **Submission Handling**: Automatic form submission processing and storage
- **Real-time Updates**: Live form state management and real-time validation feedback
- **Custom Styling**: Fully customizable components that match your design system
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and excellent developer experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first components that work on all devices
- **Analytics Integration**: Built-in tracking for form performance and conversions
- **Webhook Support**: Send form data to any endpoint or service

## What I'm Looking For:
- What features do you find most important in a form SDK/library?
- What pain points have you experienced when building forms in your applications?
- Are there any specific frameworks or tools you'd love to see supported?
- What would make you choose one form SDK over building forms from scratch?

## Pricing:
Currently offering a generous free tier for developers with paid plans starting at just $9/month for production applications and advanced features.

Any feedback, suggestions, or feature requests would be incredibly helpful as I continue to improve the platform!

Thank you!
